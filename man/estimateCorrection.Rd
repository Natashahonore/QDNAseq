\title{Estimate correction to read counts for GC content and mappability}

\usage{
estimateCorrection(object, span=0.65, family="symmetric", adjustIncompletes=TRUE,
  maxIter=1, cutoff=4, ...)
}

\description{
    Estimate correction to read counts for GC content and mappability.
}

\arguments{
    \item{object}{An \code{\link{QDNAseqReadCounts}} object with \code{counts} data.}
    \item{span}{For \code{\link[stats]{loess}}, the parameter alpha which controls
        the degree of smoothing.}
    \item{family}{For \code{\link[stats]{loess}}, if "gaussian" fitting is by
        least-squares, and if "symmetric" a re-descending M estimator is
        used with Tukey's biweight function.}
    \item{adjustIncompletes}{A boolean(1) specifying whether \code{counts} for
        bins with uncharacterized nucleotides (N's) in their reference genome
        sequence should be adjusted by dividing them with the percentage of
        characterized (A, C, G, T) nucleotides. Defaults to \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}}.}
    \item{maxIter}{An integer(1) specifying the maximum number of iterations
        to perform, default is 1. If larger, after the first loess fit, bins
        with median residuals larger than \code{cutoff} are removed, and the
        fitting repeated until the list of bins to use stabilizes or after
        \code{maxIter} iterations.}
    \item{cutoff}{A numeric(1) specifying the number of standard deviations
        (as estimated with \code{\link[matrixStats]{madDiff}}) the cutoff for removal
        of bins with median residuals larger than the cutoff. Not used if
        \code{maxIter=1} (default).}
    \item{...}{Additional aguments passed to \code{\link[stats]{loess}}.}
}

\value{
    Returns a \code{\link{QDNAseqReadCounts}} object with the assay data element
    \code{fit} added.
