\alias{makeCgh,QDNAseqCopyNumbers-method}

\title{Constructs a 'cghRaw', 'cghSeg', or 'cghCall' object}

\usage{
makeCgh(object, filter=TRUE, ...)
}

\description{
    Constructs a 'cghRaw', 'cghSeg', or 'cghCall' object.
}

\arguments{
    \item{object}{A \code{\link{QDNAseqCopyNumbers}} object.}
    \item{filter}{If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}}, bins are filtered, otherwise not.}
    \item{chromosomeReplacements}{A named integer vector of chromosome name
        replacements to be done. QDNAseq stores chromosome names as
        characters, but CGHcall expects them to be integers. Defaults to
        \code{c(X=23, Y=24, MT=25)} for human.}
    \item{...}{Not used.}
}

\value{
    Returns a \code{\link[CGHbase]{cghRaw}} if the object has not been segmented,
    a \code{\link[CGHbase]{cghSeg}} if it has been segmented but not called,
    or \code{\link[CGHbase]{cghCall}} if it has been called as well.
}

\examples{

readCounts <- LGG150

readCountsFiltered <- estimateCorrection(readCountsFiltered)
copyNumbers <- correctBins(readCountsFiltered)
copyNumbersNormalized <- normalizeBins(copyNumbers)
copyNumbersSmooth <- smoothOutlierBins(copyNumbersNormalized)
