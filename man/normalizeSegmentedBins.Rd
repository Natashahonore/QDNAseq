\title{Normalize segmented bins}

\usage{
normalizeSegmentedBins(object, inter=c(-0.1, 0.1), force=FALSE)
}

\description{
    Normalize segmented bins.
}

\arguments{
    \item{object}{An object of class QDNAseqCopyNumbers.}
    \item{inter}{The interval in which the function should search for the
        normal level.}
    \item{force}{Whether to force execution when it causes removal of
        downstream calling results.}
}
\details{
    This function recursively searches for the interval containing the
    most segmented data, decreasing the interval length in each
    recursion.    The recursive search makes the post-segmentation
    normalization robust against local maxima. This function is
    particularly useful for profiles for which, after segmentation,
    the 0-level does not coincide with many segments. It is more or
    less harmless to other profiles. We advise to keep the search
    interval (inter) small, in particular at the positive (gain) side
    to avoid that the 0-level is set to a common gain level.
}
\value{
    Returns an object of class QDNAseqCopyNumbers with re-normalized data.
