Version: 1.19.0 [2019-05-02]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.9


Version: 1.18.0 [2018-10-30]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.8


Version: 1.16.0 [2018-04-30]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.7


Version: 1.14.0 [2017-10-30]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.6


Version: 1.12.0 [2017-04-23]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.5

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * VCF and SEG file export have been implemented to allow use of 
   downstream analysis tools such as Cartegenia (NGS) Bench.

 * binReadCounts() now supports parallel computing

 * calculateBlackListByRegions() has been implemented for convient 
   bin overlap calculation of any set of regions.
      

Version: 1.10.0 [2016-10-18]

RELEASE:
   
 * Bioconductor 3.4


Version: 1.8.0 [2016-05-04]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.3

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * estimateCorrection(), segmentBins(), createBins(), and
   calculateBlacklist() now support parallel computing
   (see vignette for more details)

 * callBins() can now also use cutoffs instead of CGHcall

 * binReadCounts() now contains parameter pairedEnds to specify when using
   paired-end data, so that expected variance can be calculated correctly

 * segmentBins() now allows seeds for random number generation to be
   specified for reproducibility

 * binReadCounts() supports chunked processing of bam files

 * estimateCorrection() now also allows correcting for only GC content or
   mappability

BUG FIXES:

 * applyFilters() and highlightFilters() now work properly when using a
   numerical value for parameter residual

 * highlightFilters() no longer highlights entire chromosomes for which
   the residual filter is missing altogether, which matches the behavior of
   applyFilters()

 * getBinAnnotations() now allows custom bin annotations to be loaded via
   the path parameter even when an annotation package has been installed

 * phenodata files with a single variable are now handled correctly

 * calculateMappability() now retains correct chromosome order even when
   bigWigAverageOverBed reorders them

 * calculateBlacklist() now correctly handles non-integer chromosome names


Version: 1.6.0 [2015-10-14]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.2

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * chromosomes() no longer tries to return chromosome names as an integer
   vector, but returns a character vector instead

BUG FIXES:

 * plot() and calculateMappability() now work also for other chromosome
   names besides numbers and "X", "Y", and "MT"


Version: 1.4.2 [2015-08-20]

BUG FIXES:

 * createBins() now properly selects chromosomes when ignoring 
   mitochondrial DNA. Please note that the mitochondrial DNA is only 
   ignored when it is called either "chrMT", "chrM", "MT", or "M"


Version: 1.4.1 [2015-06-30]

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * correctBins() now filters out bins with missing loess correction estimate

Version: 1.4.0 [2015-04-17]


RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.1

Version: 1.2.4 [2015-01-21]

OTHER:

 * update package maintainer

Version: 1.2.3 [2015-01-20]

BUG FIXES:

 * createBins() now also works for species not supported by GenomeInfoDb
   (such as Canis lupus familiaris)


Version: 1.2.2 [2014-12-23]

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * applyFilters() now ignores the residual filter for chromosomes for which
   it does not exist (instead of always filtering out the entire chromosome)


Version: 1.2.1 [2014-11-01]

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * add an asterisk in the noise measure to clarify it's not a regular
   standard deviation or variance, but first scaled with the mean (so that
   the mean is 1.0 and the relationship holds between variance and 1/N, where
   N is the average number of reads per bins)

 * clarify the use of log2/sqrt transformation in segmentBins()


Version: 1.2.0 [2014-10-14]

RELEASE:

 * Bioconductor 3.0

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * segmentBins() supports another transformation option besides log2:
   sqrt(x + 3/8), which stabilizes the variance

 * plot() can skip plotting of segments and calls by specifying
   doSegments=FALSE and doCalls=FALSE

 * exportBins() also supports BED files

BUG FIXES:

 * exportBins() saves base pair positions in fixed notation instead of
   scientific


Version: 1.0.5 [2014-06-13]

BUG FIXES:

 * fix a bug caused by package matrixStats changing madDiff() from an S4
   to an S3 method in version 0.9.4, released on 2014-05-23


Version: 1.0.4 [2014-05-23]

BUG FIXES:

 * getBinAnnotations() fixed after being broken by a change in Bitbucket


Version: 1.0.3 [2014-05-23]

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * added exportBins() for exporting to a file

 * switch graphics in the vignette to PNG


Version: 1.0.2 [2014-05-15]

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * plot() honors user-specified values for xlab and xaxt

 * plot() allows omission of labels for the standard deviation and
   the number of data points

 * improve diagnostic messages


Version: 1.0.1 [2014-04-17]

BUG FIXES:

 * smoothOutlierBins() correctly ignores bins filtered out


Version: 1.0.0 [2014-04-14]

RELEASE:

 * initial release as part of Bioconductor 2.14
